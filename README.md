# python3-cyberfusion-queue-support

Library to queue actions.

# Concepts

All project specific terms are in _italic_.

After creating a _queue_, _items_ can be added to it. These _items_ can be of multiple types such as `ChmodItem` or `SystemdUnitRestartItem`, and they can have attributes such as a path for an `MkdirItem` or a unit name for a `SystemdUnitEnableItem`. Each _item_ type has one or multiple _outcomes_ that should come true for an _item_ of that type to be completed. For example: for an _item_ of type `UnlinkItem`, the _outcome_ is that the file at the path given with the _item_ is unlinked. When a _queue_ is _processed_, all the _items_ added to it are _fulfilled_, meaning all the _items'_ _outcomes_ are completed.
